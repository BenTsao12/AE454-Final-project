# AE454-Final-project
##### This project is about the result reproduction.
##### We followed the instructions from following papers to apply Controlled Langrangian to analyze the stabilization of the system
##### In this project, there are three examples:
##### 1. Inverted Pendulum on a Cart
##### 2. Rigid Spacecraft with a Symmetric Rotor
##### 3. The pendulum on a Rotor Arm

##### Example 1 and 2 are from "Stabilization of Mechanical Systems Using Controlled Lagrangians" by Anthony M. Bloch,  Naomi Ehrich Leonard, and Jerrold E. Marsden. (Primary paper)
##### Example 3 is from "Stabilization of the Pendulum on a Rotor Arm by the Method of Controlled Lagrangians" by Anthony M. Bloch,  Naomi Ehrich Leonard, and Jerrold E. Marsden.
